        <h3>Peach Custard</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>3 tbsp (50g) chunky peach jam</li>
            <li>2 tbsp (16g) corn starch</li>
            <li>1 1/2 (345g) cup milk</li>
            <li>1 tbsp (14g) butter</li>
            <li>1 tsp (5g) vanilla extract</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Buns</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (210g) cake flour + extra Â½ tbsp (\~5g) for kneading</li>
            <li>1 tsp (3g) yeast</li>
            <li>1 tbsp (13g) sugar</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>120g milk</li>
            <li>pink food coloring</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Instructions</h1>
        <h3>For Custard</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together egg yolks, peach jam, corn starch, and a pinch of salt until combined.</li>
            <li>Simmer milk in a pot on Medium heat (\~7 minutes) while occasionally stirring, then ladle a cups worth into the egg mixture. Whisk until combined, then add the egg-milk mixture back into the simmering milk.</li>
            <li>Constantly mix and simmer the mixture on Medium heat for 8 minutes until thick.</li>
            <li>Once you've reached your desired consistency, remove from the heat and add butter and vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Cool your custard to room temperature.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>For Buns</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine cake flour, yeast, sugar, and salt together.</li>
            <li>Pour in milk, and combine until a dough is formed. Knead this dough using hand-over-hand method by alternatingly pushing with the heel of your hands. Fold into itself and repeat for \~6 minutes or until the dough becomes smooth.</li>
            <li>If it is too sticky add a dusting of flour, but don't add too much as doughs tend to get smoother with kneading so just trust the process.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 6, and roll a single piece of dough out 4 times before adding in your cooled custard.</li>
            <li>Seal your dough, remove extra dough, and roll with your hands to get a smooth sphered bun.</li>
            <li>Create indentations using a bench scraper, and paint with pink food coloring.</li>
            <li>Rise for \~15 min (Vancouver was really hot that I didn't need to do this step) or until super soft and the bun feels like it's filled with air.</li>
            <li>Lastly steam for 8 minutes and enjoy! :')</li>
        </ol>
