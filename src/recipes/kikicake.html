        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Cake</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cups sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup flour (plus 2 tbsp)</li>
            <li>¼ cup cocoa powder (plus 2 tbsp)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>½ cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>½ cup cooled coffee</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Frosting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ bag mini semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>¾ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>4 tbsp salted butter</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Decoration</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup white frosting</li>
            <li>1 green icing pen</li>
            <li>1 red icing pen</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>You’ll actually want to start with your frosting, since it needs extra time to chill (in fact, you can make the frosting a day ahead of time if you want). First, place your chocolate chips in a large bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook the whipping cream and butter in a saucepan over medium heat until just boiling, stirring frequently. Pour the cream mix over the chocolate and whisk briskly until completely smooth.</li>
            <li>Place some plastic wrap over the bowl and put it in the fridge to chill. After 1 hour, stir the mix thoroughly. Replace the cover and put the mix back in the fridge for another hour or until it reaches spreading consistency.</li>
            <li>While you’re waiting for the frosting to chill, you can bake your cake! Preheat your oven to 350°. Thoroughly spray a 9-inch round cake pan with cooking spray or grease it with butter and flour. This cake likes to stick, so be sure to thoroughly coat every nook and cranny.</li>
            <li>Dump the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl. Whisk it all up!</li>
            <li>Whisk in the egg, buttermilk, coffee, oil and vanilla. Beat the mix briskly for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into your pan and bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>When fully baked, set the cake pan on a wire rack to cool for 1o minutes. Then flip the cake out of the pan and allow it to cool completely on the rack.</li>
            <li>When the cake is cool, spread on a layer of chocolate frosting. Let it set for 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Use a toothpick to draw out where you’ll put the decorative icing. This makes it easier to replicate the look of the cake in the movie. If you make a mistake, just use an icing knife or butter knife to smooth it out. </li>
            <li>Pipe your decorative icing over the toothpick drawing and allow it to set for another 5-10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Serve to your favorite little witch to congratulate her on all her hard work!</li>
