# First TOP Project - Recipes

## Start of Project

I found The Odin Project (TOP) while looking for more resources on Javascript. I completed my first project following Ania Kubow's bootcamp on Youtube and created a memory game using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. Through TOP I want to explore and learn more in depth about the languages and technologies I'll need to become a web developer, particularly the Fullstack Javascript path. So far in the Foundations course I've learned new things about Git and Github, and I'm looking forward to getting a refresher for HTML and CSS.
