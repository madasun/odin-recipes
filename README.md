# Studio Ghibli Recipes

## First TOP Project

I found The Odin Project (TOP) while looking for more resources on Javascript. I completed my first project following Ania Kubow's bootcamp on Youtube and created a memory game using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. Through TOP I want to explore and learn more in depth about the languages and technologies I'll need to become a web developer, particularly the Fullstack Javascript path. So far in the Foundations course I've learned new things about Git and Github, and I'm looking forward to getting a refresher for HTML and CSS.

# Overview

## Beginning

This started as a basic recipe website to practice html and css. I originally had a simple layout based on our dog's favorites recipes. Turns out she doesn't actually have enough recipes in her repertoire to create content for a website (that'll have to be fixed).

I decided to gather up some recipes based on food from Studio Ghibli movies. It would save me time trying to generate content because there's Ghibli recipes aplenty, and still give me the extra practice I need before moving on to new lessons. The following image is my first layout using html and css.

## Planning

After the CSS sections there were many helpful lessons on using flexbox to put things where you want them on the page. I wasn't quite ready to move on yet, so I decided to revisit the recipes website and attempt to apply my new knowledge to it. Before changing anything I sketched basic ideas to get a sense for what I wanted. Simple, muted colors, and the hope that using "polaroids" would bring focus to the recipes and add some nostalgia.

## Finished

Honestly, I could keep fiddling with this for many more hours (it's just fun!), but I made myself stop at this point. When I first started adding flexbox I found myself copy-pasting bits and pieces until it seemed like it would work. It wasn't conductive to actually learning and understanding how it all worked together though. I revisited the TOP lessons, did a lot of Google searches, and spent time really learning _how_ to fit flexbox together.

# Conclusion

I'm pretty happy with the final result of my recipes website. The html and css lessons were a great refresher, and I know more about flexbox than I ever have now. The biggest thing I'm taking away from this is putting the time into learning why something does what it does. Like _really_ learning it. Copy-pasting snippets might work, but knowing the way it all fits together made the whole process easier and more enjoyable for me in the end.
